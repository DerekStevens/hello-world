# hello-world
My first repository!
My name is Derek Stevens, I truely enjoy architectual design. In my spare time I mess around with 3d modeling for games different games I play. I hope to learn more about myself as I take an Intro to 3d modeling course. I want to know if I'm really cut out to be a 3d modeler or if I even enjoy it as much as I think I do. I guess we'll find out over the next few weeks ;)
